            <div id="Introduction">
                <p>BBC R&D are collaborating with Global Invacom Ltd to research the use of a broadcast Wi-Fi system.</p>
            
            <p>Broadcast Wi-Fi allows content to be received and consumed on mobiles, without the need to connect to mobile networks.
            
            <p>The BBC is particularly interested in exploring how broadcast <br>Wi-Fi can be used to view audio visual content at events.
            
            <p>To take part in this trial you will need to install Global Invacom's app which is available to download from both android and iOS app store(s) and can be reached by clicking the relevant link below. </p>
